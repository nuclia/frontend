description: >
  Keeps all AI-agent documentation in sync with the codebase: root AGENTS.md, per-project
  AGENTS.md files in apps/ and libs/, and knowledge embedded in .claude/skills/ and
  .claude/agents/. Activate this skill when the user mentions syncing docs after a PR or
  commit, asks "what docs need updating?", says "update knowledge", references a big feature
  that just landed ("there was a big update in commit X"), or runs the staleness check script
  and sees stale files. Also activate proactively when you notice an AGENTS.md file is missing
  for a project that was just created, or when a skill references a pattern that no longer
  matches the source code. Do NOT wait for the user to explicitly say "knowledge sync" — if
  code has changed and docs might be stale, this skill applies immediately.

# Knowledge Sync

The goal is to keep every piece of AI-agent documentation accurate and up-to-date so that any
agent can work confidently in any project without re-discovering facts that are already known.

**Three layers of documentation to maintain:**
1. **Root `AGENTS.md`** — workspace-wide: apps list, libs list, run commands, shared conventions
2. **Per-project `AGENTS.md`** — in `apps/<name>/` and `libs/<name>/`: routing, services, state, gotchas
3. **Skills & agents** in `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` — patterns, idioms, workflows

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Determine Scope

Ask yourself (or confirm with the user) which of these applies:

| Scope | When to use | Git command |
|---|---|---|
| **Single commit** | User names a commit hash | `git show <hash> --name-only` |
| **Branch diff** | Reviewing a PR or feature branch | `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` |
| **Full audit** | Periodic maintenance or "everything feels stale" | Run the staleness script (see Step 2) |
| **Just new apps/libs** | After a scaffold-only change | Check for missing AGENTS.md files |

Default to `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` if no explicit scope is given.

### Step 2 — Detect Staleness

Run the staleness check script to find outdated docs:

```bash
.claude/skills/knowledge-sync/scripts/check-staleness.sh
```

Or manually: for each project, check if its AGENTS.md is older than the newest source file:

```bash
# Check a specific project
find apps/auth/src -newer apps/auth/AGENTS.md -name "*.ts" 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Find projects with no AGENTS.md at all
for dir in apps/*/  libs/*/; do
  [ ! -f "${dir}AGENTS.md" ] && echo "MISSING: ${dir}AGENTS.md"
done
```

### Step 3 — Build the Staleness Map

Given the list of changed files, populate this map:

| Changed path | Documentation to update | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/<X>/` (new folder) | Create `apps/<X>/AGENTS.md` + add row to root `AGENTS.md` | CRITICAL |
| `apps/<X>/src/app/*routing*` | Update routing tree in `apps/<X>/AGENTS.md` | HIGH |
| `apps/<X>/src/app/*guard*` | Update guards section in `apps/<X>/AGENTS.md` | HIGH |
| `apps/<X>/src/app/*.state.ts` | Update state section in `apps/<X>/AGENTS.md` | HIGH |
| `apps/<X>/` (general changes) | Review `apps/<X>/AGENTS.md` for accuracy | MEDIUM |
| `libs/<X>/` (new folder) | Create `libs/<X>/AGENTS.md` + add row to root `AGENTS.md` | CRITICAL |
| `libs/<X>/` (general changes) | Review `libs/<X>/AGENTS.md` | MEDIUM |
| `libs/sdk-core/src/lib/` | Review `.claude/skills/api-sdk/SKILL.md` for stale API patterns | HIGH |
| `libs/sistema/` | Review `.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md` for stale component names | MEDIUM |
| `libs/pastanaga-angular/` | Review `.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md` | MEDIUM |
| `libs/user/` auth flows | Review `.claude/skills/angular-patterns/SKILL.md` auth section | MEDIUM |
| `libs/user/src/assets/i18n/` | Review `.claude/skills/i18n-patterns/SKILL.md` | LOW |
| New file in `.claude/skills/` | Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` skills list | CRITICAL |
| New file in `.claude/agents/` | Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` agents list | CRITICAL |
| `charts/` or `docker/` | Review root `AGENTS.md` deployment section if one exists | LOW |

### Content ROI Quick Reference

Use this when deciding what belongs in an AGENTS.md. The full detailed framework lives in
`.claude/skills/agents-review/SKILL.md`, but these criteria cover the most common decisions.

**Core test:** "Can an agent discover this in under 5 seconds by reading the source? If yes, skip it."

#### High ROI — Always Include

- **Non-obvious invariants and runtime constraints** — things that look like bugs but are intentional
- **Custom architecture patterns unique to the project** — not inferable from filenames alone
- **Guards with their enforced conditions** — agents will accidentally route around unknown guards
- **File structure tree with one-line annotations**
- **Run commands** — `nx serve/test/build` with the exact project name
- **Flag interactions and mutual exclusions** — cannot be found without running code
- **Intentional divergence from workspace norms** — hash routing, eslint-disable on purpose, etc.
- **Critical API usage distinctions** — when to use one method vs another, why something emits multiple values

#### Low ROI — Skip These

- **Method signature tables** — agents read source directly
- **Model/interface property lists** — duplication of `*.models.ts`
- **Constants and enum value lists** — greppable in under 2 seconds
- **External dependency tables** — already in `package.json`
- **Integration tutorials / README content** — AGENTS.md is for contributors, not integrators
- **Public API re-export indexes** — note the barrel and categories, don't list all symbols
- **Boilerplate descriptions redundant with filenames**

#### Token Budget Targets

| Project type | Target | Max |
|---|---:|---:|
| Small lib (< 10 source files) | ~1,000 tokens | 2,000 |
| Medium lib or app | ~2,000 tokens | 4,000 |
| Large lib (`libs/common`, `libs/core`) | ~3,000 tokens | 5,500 |

Files above max almost certainly duplicate source. Keep conventions and structure; cut method tables.

### Step 4 — Execute Updates

Work through the staleness map from **CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW**.

#### 4a. New project — create AGENTS.md

If a new app or lib was created and has no AGENTS.md:
1. Read the project's `project.json`, routing files, main module/component tree, and key services
2. Write the file from scratch, applying the **Content ROI Quick Reference** above — include high-ROI items (guards, structure tree, run commands, non-obvious constraints), skip low-ROI items (method tables, model lists, dependency tables). Use the `agents-review` skill for the full evaluation framework if needed.
3. Then add a row for the project in the root `AGENTS.md` apps or libs table

#### 4b. Existing project — update AGENTS.md

If source files changed in a project that already has an AGENTS.md:
1. Read the diff for that project: `git diff <scope> -- apps/<X>/`
2. Read the current `apps/<X>/AGENTS.md`
3. Identify which facts are now wrong or missing (routing changes, renamed services, new guards)
4. Edit the file in-place — do not rewrite sections that are still accurate
5. Verify every class name, method name, and file path mentioned still exists in source
6. Apply the **Content ROI Quick Reference** above — actively remove any low-ROI content (method signature tables, model property lists, dependency tables, integration tutorials) that snuck in. Use the `agents-review` skill for the full evaluation framework if the file needs a deeper overhaul.

#### 4c. Skills and agents — update inline knowledge

If a skill's documented patterns no longer match the source, update that skill directly.
Key signals that a skill is stale:
- A class or method name it references was renamed (check with `grep -r "OldName" src/`)
- A route path it documents was changed
- A new pattern was introduced that contradicts the skill's guidance (e.g. new state management approach)
- An import alias was changed in `tsconfig.base.json`

Do NOT rewrite skills speculatively — only update what is verifiably wrong.

#### 4d. Root AGENTS.md

The root `AGENTS.md` needs updating when:
- A new app or lib is added (add a row to the table)
- An app is removed or renamed (update the table)
- A workspace-wide convention changes (e.g. switching test runner, changing package manager)
- Running commands change (ports, build commands, etc.)

### Step 5 — Report

After completing updates, produce a concise summary:

```
## Knowledge Sync Report

**Scope:** <commit hash / branch / full audit>
**Changed projects detected:** <comma-separated list>

### Created
- <file path> — <one line reason>

### Updated
- <file path> — <what changed>

### Verified accurate (no changes needed)
- <file path>

### Skipped / Could not verify
- <file path> — <reason>

### Automation reminder
<Any files still stale that require manual verification, e.g. skill files that may reference
outdated patterns but the change was too subtle to verify automatically.>
```

## Source-to-Docs Mapping Reference

Use this when you need to reason about which skill or agent is the authoritative owner of a
given piece of knowledge:

| Source of truth | Authoritative doc |
|---|---|
| `libs/sdk-core/src/lib/` | `.claude/skills/api-sdk/SKILL.md` |
| `libs/sistema/` | `.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md` |
| `libs/pastanaga-angular/` | `.claude/skills/design-system/SKILL.md` |
| `libs/user/` (auth flows) | `.claude/skills/angular-patterns/SKILL.md` + `apps/auth/AGENTS.md` |
| `*.state.ts` patterns | `.claude/skills/angular-patterns/SKILL.md` |
| `*.spec.ts` patterns | `.claude/skills/testing-patterns/SKILL.md` |
| RxJS usage in services | `.claude/skills/rxjs-patterns/SKILL.md` |
| `libs/*/src/assets/i18n/` | `.claude/skills/i18n-patterns/SKILL.md` |
| `nx.json`, `project.json` | `.claude/skills/nx-monorepo/SKILL.md` |
| App routing trees | Per-project `AGENTS.md` routing section |
| Guards | Per-project `AGENTS.md` gotchas/guards section |
| Feature flags | Per-project `AGENTS.md` gotchas section |

---

## Workspace Indexing

VS Code can index the workspace to help Copilot find code it hasn't seen.
This is **complementary** to AGENTS.md, not a replacement:

| Feature | Workspace Index | AGENTS.md |
|---|---|---|
| Finds any symbol by name | ✅ | ❌ |
| Understands architecture intent | ❌ | ✅ |
| Knows routing tree | ❌ (infers poorly) | ✅ |
| Knows non-obvious gotchas | ❌ | ✅ |
| Knows which guard enforces what | ❌ | ✅ |
| Costs tokens per query | Yes (reads file content) | No (already in context) |

**Recommendation:** Enable workspace indexing — it helps Copilot resolve symbols it cannot find
from context alone. But never rely on it for architectural or convention knowledge; that belongs
in AGENTS.md. Well-written AGENTS.md files reduce token usage by providing curated facts
instead of requiring the AI to scan source files on every turn.

## Automation: Never Forget to Sync

Run the git hook installer to get automatic staleness reminders after every `git pull` or merge:

```bash
.claude/skills/knowledge-sync/scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

What the hook does:
1. After `git pull` or `git merge`, runs the staleness check
2. If stale docs are found, prints a specific list to the terminal
3. Does NOT block your workflow — just prints a reminder

To trigger a full knowledge sync manually:

```bash
# Check what's stale
.claude/skills/knowledge-sync/scripts/check-staleness.sh

# Then ask Claude: "run knowledge sync for commit <hash>"
# or: "run knowledge sync for the current branch diff"
```

You can also add a VS Code task — see `.claude/skills/knowledge-sync/scripts/vscode-task.json`
for a ready-made task definition to drop into `.vscode/tasks.json`.

## Common Patterns to Watch For

When reviewing changed diffs for knowledge-impacting changes, look for:

- **New `app.module.ts` or new standalone `app.component.ts`** → new app bootstrapped
- **New `*-routing.module.ts` or `Routes` array changes** → routing tree changed
- **New `*.guard.ts`** → guards section needs updating
- **New `*.state.ts` or new `BehaviorSubject` fields** → state section may need updating
- **Changes to `index.ts` barrel exports** → public API of a lib changed
- **New `environment*.ts` files** → environment configuration may have changed
- **Changes to `tsconfig.base.json` paths** → path aliases changed, update root AGENTS.md
- **New `i18n/*.json` keys** → check i18n-patterns skill if key naming convention changed
- **New `@NgModule` or removal of `@NgModule`** → module architecture changed
