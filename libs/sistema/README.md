# sistema

Nuclia's design system is based on [Pastanaga angular](https://github.com/plone/pastanaga-angular)
which provides a lot of angular UI components properly tested and fully responsive.

Sistema library contains Nuclia's specific theme and assets, as well as any UI component which doesn't belong to Pastanaga (those components are prefixed by `nsi-`).
