## Prerequisites

First you need to have NVM, NODE and YARN installed.

To install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), run:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

or

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

To check if it was installed properly, close and reopen the terminal and run `command -v nvm` and should return `nvm`. In case there is something else going on, troubleshoot with [this documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#troubleshooting-on-macos). To see all the commands, simply run `nvm`.

To install the latest stable version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en), run:

```
nvm install --lts
```

To check if node and npm is properly installed, run: `node --version` and `npm --version`.
<sub>Any problems should be resolved with the [nvm documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme).</sub>

To install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable), run:

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Check if Yarn is installed by running: `yarn --version`.

#### Note

In the rest of this documentation, we use commands like `nx` and `missdev`. Those can be find in `node_modules/.bin` folder. To use them directly you can add `node_modules/.bin` folder to your command line path.
You can also install `nx` globally:

```
npm install -g nx
```

## Dependencies installation

```
yarn
```

Pastanaga-angular installation must be done through [missdev](https://github.com/collective/mrs-developer) so `sistema-demo` can run:

```
yarn missdev
```

If it fails for any reason, you can try to clone Pastanaga manually:

```
cd libs
git clone git@github.com:plone/pastanaga-angular.git
```

## Dashboard

Start by creating an account with an email and password (as SSO doesn't work locally).

- for Nuclia employees:

  In `apps/dashboard/src/environments_config`, create a file `local-stage/app-config.json` with the correct configuration to use the stage server. <sub>Ask a supervisor to get a proper configuration.</sub>

  Then you can run the dashboard locally and use the credential created previously to log in:

  ```
  nx serve dashboard
  ```

- for external developers:

  You can use the production server with your real account by running:

  ```
  nx serve dashboard -c local-prod
  ```

  Note: the login page will automatically redirect you to the https://nuclia.cloud so you can login and will redirect back to http://localhost:4200 with the auth token.

## Widget

[Documentation](https://docs.nuclia.dev/docs/docs/using/widget/features)

In the demo, the knowledge box id is hardcoded in `apps/search-widget-demo/src/App.svelte`.
Before launching the demo, replace this id by the one for your own **public** knowledge box.

Run the demo:

```
nx serve search-widget-demo
```

Build the widget:

```
nx build search-widget
```

When you have some local changes to the widget you'd like to test on the dashboard, you need to:

- build the widget
- copy the resulting `nuclia-widget.umd.js` to `assets` folder of dashboard app
- in `app.init.service.ts`, replace the line `injectWidget(config.backend.cdn);` to `injectWidget('/assets');`

## SDK

[Documentation](https://docs.nuclia.dev/docs/docs/sdk/js_sdk_api)

## Sistema

Sistema is Nuclia's design system. It is based on [Pastanaga](https://github.com/plone/pastanaga-angular).

The demo is available at [https://nuclia.github.io/frontend](https://nuclia.github.io/frontend).

To update the glyphs sprite:

- add/remove/edit glyphs in `libs/sistema/glyphs` folder
- run `update_icons` script:

```shell
./libs/sistema/scripts/update_icons.sh
```

## Protobuf library

Get lastest proto files from nucliadb (assuming nucliadb and frontend are in 2 siblings folders):

```sh
cd libs/sdk-core/protobuf
./update.sh
```

Build the library:

```sh
cd libs/sdk-core/protobuf
./build.sh
```

Publish the library:

```sh
cd libs/sdk-core/protobuf/build/protobuf
npm publish
```

## CI/CD Deployment

### Scope

CI/CD deployment does not cover:

- the SDK as it is released in the NPM registry;
- the NucliaDB admin app as it is released in the Python registry.

It covers:

- the dashboard (not active at the time I am writing this doc, but will be soon);
- the widget (not active at the time I am writing this doc, but will be soon);
- the manager app

### Deploying to stage

When merging a PR, if it impacts the manager app, it is built and our `deploy_manager` job (in our `deploy` GitHub Action) will update Helm and then trigger a Repository Dispatch event to the `frontend_deploy` repo.

That's how the manager is deployed to **stage**.

You can see the deployment on [Stage ArgoCD](http://stashify.argocd.nuclia.com/applications/argocd/manager?view=tree&conditions=false&resource=).

### Promoting to production

Once the app is deployed on stage, you can promote it to production by going to https://github.com/nuclia/stage/actions/workflows/promote-to-production.yaml and clicking on "Run workflow".
Then, choose `app` or `manager` component in the list (keep the default values for the rest) and click on "Run workflow".

It triggers the prod promotion, and it can be monitored on [http://europe1.argocd.nuclia.com/applications/app?resource=](http://europe1.argocd.nuclia.com/applications/app?resource=) or [http://europe1.argocd.nuclia.com/applications/argocd/manager?view=tree&resource=](http://europe1.argocd.nuclia.com/applications/argocd/manager?view=tree&resource=).

To deploy the widget, use [https://github.com/nuclia/frontend_deploy/actions/workflows/cdn-sync.yaml](https://github.com/nuclia/frontend_deploy/actions/workflows/cdn-sync.yaml).

### About ArgoCD

ArgoCD allows to monitor deployments and also to read the logs of the different pods.

## Maintenance page

The maintenance page is in `./maintenance`.
It is deployed manually to stage using the following command:

```sh
gsutil cp -r ./maintenance gs://stashify-cdn
```
